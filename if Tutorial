x = int(input("Please enter an integer: ")) # assigning an integer to "x" as an input after the input sentence
if x < 0: # "if" statement of when "x is zero"
    x = 0 # you assign 0
    print('Negative changed to zero') # print the sentence if x is less than zero
elif x == 0: # else if statement of if the value enter is 0
    print('Zero') # print zero if the value entered is zero
elif x == 1: # else if statement of if value entered is 1 
    print('Single') # print single if value entered is 1
else:
    print('More') # else statement if not less than 0, or 0 or 1 print "more"
print ("the final value of x:", x) # here the final value of X is printed
