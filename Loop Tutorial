# Loop Tutorial

i = 1 # Assigning the integer number 1 to i
while i<=10: # this is a "while" statement which creates a loop as long a "i" is less than or equal to 10
    print (i) # print the value of "i" 
    i= 1+i # this allows the loop to close by calualating the next integer based off "1"
print ('the final number is:',i) # this prints the sentence with the last calculation of "i"
