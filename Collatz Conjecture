# Exercise 3 the Collatz Conjecture

y = int(input("Please enter a positive integer: ")) # this is the starting statement to prompt an input to the program
x = 0 # this was tricky and took me ages to figure out, it is the start of a counter to stop the programming going into a loop
while y > 1: # this is the start if the while statement, basically saying whilr y is greater than 1 run the statements below
 if y % 2 == 0: # this "if" statement is to check for an even number, if the remained of y divided by 2 is zero, it is defined as even
    y= (y/2) # if "y" us even divide by 2
    print (y) # print the result "y"
 elif y % 2 == 1: # this is an else if statement, if "y" divided by 2 leaves a remainder of 1 it is an odd number
    y = (y*3+1) # if "y" an odd number multiple it by 3 and add 1.
    print (y) # print your result
 else: 
    print (y) # this is an else statement detailing to print "y", this is not required as the very first while statement outlines y > 1
 x = x + 1 # this defines the end of the loop i.e. x= 0 start x = x+1 = end

print ("the Final Value of the Collatz Conjecture is:", y) # this is just a line added to show out to print a final statement based off the last result, copied from the "if" statement tutorial
