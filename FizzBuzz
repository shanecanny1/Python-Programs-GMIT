i=1 # assign "i" the integer nmuber 1

while i <= 100: # "while" statement repeat program while "i" is less than or equal to 100
 if (i % 3 == 0) and (i % 5 == 0): # "if" statements, if the result of "i" divided by 3 or 5 is 0 write "FizzBuzz"
  print("FizzBuzz") # print "FizzBuzz" based on the if statement above i.e. if "i" has a remainder of 0 after division by 3 or 5
 elif i % 3 == 0: # else if statement detailing to divide "i" by 3 and if the remainder is 0
  print("Fizz") # print "Fizz" based off the previous else if statement i.e. if "i" is divisible by 3 with no remainder print "Fizz"
 elif i % 5 == 0: # else if statement detailing to divide "i" by 5 and if the remainder is 0
  print("Buzz") # print "Buzz" based off the previous else if statement i.e. if "i" is divisible by 5 with no remainder print "Buzz"
 else: # else statement for when any of the statements above are not applicable
  print(i) # print "i" based off the else statement above i.e. print "i" when none of the statements above are applicable
 i = i + 1 # allowing "i" to count up for the "while" statement
