  for i in range (11, 21): # using a for statement to create a loop in the range of 11 to 21
   if (number % i != 0): # using an if statement to check if the unknown number modulo i leave a remainder of 0 
    return False # if the remainder is not zero, False is returned
  return True # if the remainder is zero, True is returned
number = 2520 # number is assigned the number 2520
while True: # while statement being used when the contents of i modulo number gives a remainder of zero
  if euler5(number): # if statement used calling in the defined variable
    break # breaking the loop from the while statement
  number += 2520 # increaase the number 2520 by 1 sequentially

  print (number) # print the number

print ("The Number that all integers from 1 to 20 divides evenly into is:", number)
